								<h3>Your Data, Privacy and Security</h3>
								<ol>
									<li>
										By using the Reflection Service, you continue to own all data we collect from you 
										or your App Platform Account, including any personal data, User Input Data and

									</li>
									<li>
										Your User Input Data (such as iTunes Sale Reports) informs our App Intelligence 
										but remains private to you. We do not share your User Input Data with other users of 
										the Reflection Service. You can view and analyse your own User Input Data in the 
										"My Apps" section of the Reflection Service, but this data is not visible to 
										Reflection Users outside of your organisation.
									</li>

									<li>
										We retain information you provide us (<strong>except</strong> your User Input Data and User Account Information) for as long as is necessary to comply with our legal obligations or resolve disputes.
									</li>
									<li>
										We use cookies. When you use the Reflection Service, we may collect, process and use information about you which may not personally identify you but which may be helpful for improving the operation of the Site. Such information may be collected through “traffic data” and may entail the use of cookies, IP Addresses or other numeric codes used to identify your device and compile information about your use of the Reflection Service to help us improve it. Some cookies we use are set by third party analytics service (currently Google Analytics and Qbit). You can delete cookies or configure your device to reject them, although this may disable the ability of the Reflection Service to manage individual sessions.
									</li>
									<li>
										We will never sell or share your data with any third parties, or use it in any way that is not necessary for the purpose of compiling and analysing our App Intelligence, without your prior consent.
									</li>
									<li>
										<strong>We take the security of your data very seriously</strong>. The data host we currently use is Google Cloud Platform, whose Terms of Service and Privacy Policy can be read for further information on the data privacy and security measures taken to protect your data. All data hosted on the Google Cloud Platform solution is protected with state of the art SSL encryption.
